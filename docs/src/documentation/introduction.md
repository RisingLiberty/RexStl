## Introduction

Internal classes, function and types of rsl are defined in the rsl::internal namespace.
These implementations can possibly change in newer versions of rsl.

Changes to these classes, functions and types won't be included in the release notes and are therefore not recommended for use as they can cause bugs or compiler errors when changing rsl version when a user expects certain behavior.
