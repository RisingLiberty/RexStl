if you want to check which compiler you're compiling on, use the rex compiler macros
eg. REX_COMPILER_MSVC


or if you want to check the compiler without macros, use RexCompiler constant which holds the compiler that's used to compile the code base
(this still needs to get added, is this a good idea?)
