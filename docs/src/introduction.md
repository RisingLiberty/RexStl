## Introduction

Internal classes, function and types of rtl are defined in the rtl::internal namespace.
These implementations can possibly change in newer versions of RTL.
Changes to these classes, functions and types won't be included in the release notes and are therefore not recommended for use as they can cause bugs or compiler errors when changing RTL version when a user expects certain behavior.
