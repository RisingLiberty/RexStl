## Foreword

The goal of this guide is to be consistent throughout the code base with dos and don’ts when writing C++ code. The goal of these guidelines is to provide a codebase with clearly defined rules and structure to make it easier to work with.

Some of the rules described here won’t be to your liking, and that’s okay, some rules take time to get used to, but with practice, you do get used to them after a while. Code is read way more often than it is written, these guidelines focus heavily on that, readability improves maintainability and productivity.

If you have any doubts about a certain style or have a suggestion for a new one, contact Nick De Breuck or Dave De Breuck for more info on how to upgrade the coding guidelines.

## Introduction

**REX** is a real-time interactive application and rendering engine created by Dave De Breuck and Nick De Breuck.
The accompanied **REGINA** tool is the name of the editor which is build on **REX**

Within this documentation you can find specific guidelines on how code within **REX** is structred and styled.
When contributions are added to **REX** we would like to inform you to maintain this style.
