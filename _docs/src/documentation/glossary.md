## Important differences between words
In the coding worlds data types and byte size are closely related, but they're not the same.
a byte is not the same as a char, a word is not the same as a short.
bytes, words, dwords are different __sizes__, chars, shorts, int, are different __types__.

therefore be careful which word you use and where you use it.

| size | type |
| ---- | ---- |
| byte | char |
| word | short |
| dword | int |
